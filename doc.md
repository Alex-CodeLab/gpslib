Sensor-fusion is the process of combining two or more 
data sources to get a better understanding of the system.

The datasource could be a sensor, but also a mathematical model.

SensorFusion can increase the quality of the data, 
increase reliability and can estimate unmeasured states.


Orientation (attitude, heading) can be estimated
using magnetometer, accelerometer and gyro (IMU).
